/*
The signToken() function expects a user object and will add that user's username, email, and _id properties to the token. 
Optionally, tokens can be given an expiration date and a secret to sign the token with. 
Note that the secret has nothing to do with encoding. The secret merely enables the server to verify whether it recognizes this token.

If your JWT secret is ever compromised, you'll need to generate a new one, 
immediately invalidating all current tokens. 
Because the secret is so important, 
you should store it somewhere other than in a JavaScript fileâ€”like an environment variable.

After receiving this token, the client can continue to send it with any other requests. The back end will then decode the token and know exactly who was making the request, because all of the user's information is saved on the token itself

This is where the secret becomes important. If the secret on jwt.verify() doesn't match the secret that was used with jwt.sign(), the object won't be decoded. When the JWT verification fails, an error is thrown.
